# Solana SBPF Runtime in RISC Zero zkVM

This project implements a **zero-knowledge proof execution environment for Solana programs**. It allows Solana BPF programs to be executed within RISC Zero's zkVM, generating cryptographic proofs of correct execution. The core problem is bridging Solana's runtime (SBPF) with RISC Zero's proving system to enable verifiable off-chain computation of Solana programs.

## Key Technical Components

1. **SBPF VM Integration**
   - Loads Solana bytecode and creates SBPF executable
   - Sets up memory regions (stack, heap, input parameters)
   - Implements compute budget tracking (200k CU default)

2. **Syscall Implementation**
   - Core Solana syscalls: `sol_log_`, `sol_memcpy_`, `sol_memmove_`, `sol_memset_`, `sol_memcmp_`
   - Memory-safe implementations using SBPF's memory mapping
   - Compute unit consumption tracking for each operation

3. **Account Serialization**
   - Implements Solana's account input format
   - Handles memory alignment (BPF_ALIGN_OF_U128)
   - Supports account data expansion (MAX_PERMITTED_DATA_INCREASE)

## Alignment with Bonsol's Vision

This implementation aligns perfectly with Bonsol's goal of being a "ZK co-processor for Solana":

1. **Off-chain Computation**: Executes Solana programs in zkVM environment
2. **Proof Generation**: Creates verifiable proofs of execution
3. **Solana Native**: Maintains compatibility with existing Solana programs
4. **Efficiency Focus**: Tracks compute units and optimizes for proof size

## Areas for Enhancement
1. **Limited Syscalls**: Only basic memory operations implemented
2. **No Cross-Program Invocation**: Missing CPI support
3. **Static Account Model**: No dynamic account creation/modification
4. **Missing Sysvars**: Clock, rent, slot hashes not available

## Strategic Value
- Enables complex computation (ML, analytics) for Solana programs
- Maintains Solana's security model through ZK proofs
- Foundation for privacy-preserving DeFi applications
- Bridge to cross-chain verification scenarios

This implementation represents a crucial building block for Bonsol's vision of unlimited computational possibilities on Solana while maintaining verifiability and security through zero-knowledge proofs.
